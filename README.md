# From Kaggle about Kagglers

One and half years ago, when I made my final decision to transition my career from banking to data science, I joined Kaggle, because that’s what you do when you’re a data scientist or when you want to become one. After a while of exploring the platform and seeing all the cool visualizations and Machine Learning projects, the first feeling was intimidation. I was thinking to myself if I ever can learn so much and eventually do projects of high quality that will drive action. </br>

After some unproductive thoughts, the intimidation turned into immense motivation and enthusiasm. I said to myself, “Challenge Accepted,” and it’s going to be “Legendary!”</br>

Now, I pursue the career path I have always wanted, and when I remembered the one-year-younger-me, I decided to go and learn who Kagglers actually are and where they come from, as well as understand the general trends in the industry.</br>

Let’s get started. </br>

## Graph 1: Age-Gender & Role-Country Distribution

So, according to this graph, the majority are male, between 18-40 years old, predominantly from India and the USA. In terms of age, we have a wide distribution; however, in terms of gender, there is still a huge gap between males and females in this and other tech fields. It’s also notable that according to the second graph, we see that the majority of our target market are students from India, as well as Data Scientists and Software Engineers from the USA.</br>

## Graph 2: Activities that make up an important part of the role at work</br>

Now, let’s see what they do at work. As the data reveals, the number one activity is geared towards data-driven decision making and applying Machine Learning to new areas of the company to increase efficiency and productivity. Today, more than ever, companies understand that ML can significantly augment the human capabilities, and even though some people might think the future is a bleak and terrifying dystopia ruled by murderous sentient robots, as it is usually depicted in science-fiction movies, the reality (at least in the foreseeable future) is that ML is pure math, which became possible due to the increase in computational power of our computers that we now take as granted. </br>

## Graph 3: Spending on ML and/or Cloud Computing products in the past 5 years</br>

We can also look at the amount of investments that the companies are currently making in this field, and it should come as little surprise that an increasing number of companies are investing in their Machine Learning and Cloud Computing capabilities. </br>

It’s fascinating that small companies (0-49 employees) are really active in the range from 100 to 99,999 dollars. On the other hand, it’s not surprising that large corporations dominate the investments above 100,000 dollars. Sure, while some companies do not invest in Machine Learning, the overall trend is that most do than those that don’t.</br>

## Graph 4: The number of individuals responsible for data science workloads based on the company size</br>

This trend is also visible by the number of data scientists in companies. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that, generally, the big corporations can afford to have multiple data scientists. However, medium companies also try to keep up with the trends and invest in such technologies when they see a potential value and when their capabilities allow.</br> 

## Graph 5: Machine Learning maturity level</br>

For a complete understanding of the industry, it’s also useful to look at where the companies are in terms of Machine Learning maturity. According to the graph, generally it’s the large corporations that have well-established Machine Learning methods in place; however, it’s promising that the rest of the companies are also exploring and experimenting with the perks that the ML can potentially deliver, starting from enhanced customer experience to more informed decisions.</br>

## Graph 6: The type of tools other than local development environments (JupyterLab, etc.)</br>
![](https://github.com/tmargary/kaggle_ml_ds_survey_2019/blob/master/graphs/6.png)

In this context, when we look at what tools are used other than local development environments (such as RStudio or JupyterLab), we gain additional insights. As the graph shows, cloud-based software and APIs are the second widely used tools in this field (after IDEs, which is not in the graph), which became a defining trend in the past five years. AWS, for example, offers over 175 fully-featured services from data centers globally, which is a game-changer. Such services make the applications run faster, easier, and more cost-effective ways, which is unprecedented in the analytics field. Cloud services are an enabling factor for AI, too, which became the cornerstone to lots of companies. Just the fact that AI can be used to solve problems before they even occur makes it a potent tool, especially for detecting hardware failures. </br>

## Conclusion</br>

Data Science is growing, embedding itself in various industries regardless of their size and industry. Companies leverage the capabilities of Machine Learning and Data Science to run their businesses faster, easier, and in a more cost-effective ways. The field becomes more and more democratized, which augments human capabilities in various contexts. After all, ideally, this is all about better human experiences. </br>
